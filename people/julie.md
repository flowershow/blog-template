Julie Stone is a full-stack developer and habitual café-hopper who believes the best breakthroughs happen between sips of espresso. By day she builds React and Go projects for an indie SaaS studio; by night she experiments with side-projects, refactors old code, and catalogs every new coffee bean she tries. When she’s not debugging, you’ll find her sketch-noting conference talks, mentoring newcomers in local dev meetups, or cycling the city in search of the next pour-over to review.
